       "\"I like to keep my screens clean, from my laptop to my iPod, GPS, Kindle, digital cameras and more. However it can be difficult when traveling since I don't want to carry bottles of cleaning fluid in my luggage.  These pre-packaged wipes are really nice to have an easy to carry around.First I start with the wet wipe to remove grease and dirt, then I remove the moisture with the dry wipe.  You want to practice with it in order to not leave any streaks but it's not too difficult to do. The wet wipes are not only good for screens but they take figure prints off the exterior on my laptop.  I still use my bottle of cleaning liquid and cleaning clothes for my flat screen television since it is too big for these small tissues.  However, for traveling these are great!\""
